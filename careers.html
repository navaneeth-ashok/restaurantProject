                <!--Why Work for Breadbox Cafe-->
                When Breadbox Cafe opened our doors in 1843, Jebediah Breadbox had one goal, to make the perfect loaf of bread. Now, we don't know if he did that, and he's definitely long-dead so don't bother asking him. 
                But we do know one thing, The Huntington Brothers Chemical Distributors and Mortgage Brokerage (us!) acquired his bakery in an estate sale after his descendants were arrested for tax fraud. 
            </p>
            <p class="career-sell">   
                Hundreds of people have had the pleasure of walking through our doors to join the "Breadbox Cafe" family. Although many of our workers have since moved on to other parts 
                (some may say better, but we will be pursuing legal action with them) of our wonderful, bread-based industry, they always carry with them the fact that they got their start in the business with us. 
                We like to think of ourselves as a sourdough starter in the bread loaves that are our former employees life. 
            </p>    
            <p class="career-sell">
                And - as we all know - Without a good starter, your bread's going to be boring. 
            </p>
            <p class="career-sell">
                Our employees get great hands-on training, retirement and health benefits, option tuition reimbursement and an annual increase on paid vacation days as a loyalty bonus. 
                Salary/pay is commensurate on experience. 
            </p>
